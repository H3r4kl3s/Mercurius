<h1 align="center">Mercurius</h1>

<p>Mercurius is a TCP chat with encrypted messages created using Python. The main Software is Mercurius, which can be executed in "two states": Server and Client. For a communication to take place, there must be a Server running. The server, up until now at least, only receives the messages, displays them, broadcasts them to all the clients, and accepts or denies connections -- based on the password. Only clients cand send messages. When the clients connect to the server, the first input must be the password.</p>
<p>For the encryption to happen, there must be a key file and a password files. All the parts involved in the communication need the same key file, which can be generated by the software make_file.py. The password file, on the other hand, only needs to be used by the Server, not the Clients. The password file can also be created by make_file.py</p>
