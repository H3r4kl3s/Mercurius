<h1>Mercurius</h1>

  Mercurius is a TCP chat with encrypted messages created using Python. The main Software is Mercurius, which can be executed in "two states": Server and Client. For a communication to take place, there must be a Server running. The server, up until now at least, only receives the messages, displays them, broadcasts them to all the clients, and accepts or denies connections -- based on the password. Only clients cand send messages. When the clients connect to the server, the first input must be the password.
  For the encryption to happen, there must be a key file and a password files. All the parts involved in the communication need the same key file, which can be generated by the software make_file.py. The password file, on the other hand, only needs to be used by the Server, not the Clients. The password file can also be created by make_file.py
